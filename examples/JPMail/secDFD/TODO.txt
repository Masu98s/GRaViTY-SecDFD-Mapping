TODO:
-scenario 2; not sure if that is so interesting for us anymore. jpmail-full-0.3.1/demo/addnewuser.sh 
			; seems like adding new user is standard certificate issuing by a trusted CA -> they are using the Java keytool certificate management utility. 
			; Will we even reverse engineer that?
-changes to model analysis to support more than one principle (Bono)

-Q: detail the model with subprocesses?

-more scenarios; 
	what if there are two recipients?
	model spoofing - someone manipulating the header `from'







DONE:
-same naming if elements vis-a-vis source code
-keep a log of what you are matching from code to model;
	there are references to the source code method calls in comments
-scenario 1: JPmail-bono.mydsl	
-scenario 3: JPmail-attachment.mysdl
	
	
----------- notes -----------
# detail the model (not to much); more subprocesses

# scenario 1
- add EE Bono
- add scenario when Bono tries to read Alices mail that is sent to Bob
- requires changing the label propagation to propagate according to the right principles (access control)

# scenario 2
- setting up the certificates for one user (Alice)

# scenario 3
- mails with attachment
